I'm Professor and Researcher in Computer Science (University of Rennes / IRISA / Inria, France). 
With this blog, I want to share some thoughts, ideas, and experiments related to (list is complete): 
 * software
 * data
 * variability
 * artificial intelligence
 * chess
 * research/science
 * education
 * football/soccer/sports
 * music

I won't necessarily talk about my core research, so it can be seen as a complement to [https://www.mathieuacher.com/](http://www.mathieuacher.com/).
