I recently watched a great talk by Peter van Hardenberg (aka pvh) titled *"Why Can't We Make Simple Software?"*. The talk dives into the deep-rooted reasons behind the multiple kinds of complexity in software systems â€” even the seemingly simple ones. A brief summary and some thoughts in this post.

Peter walks through a range of issues:
 * robustness and how software generalizes to inputs... pvh elaborates on "defensive programming" and why simple solutions often fail to handle the full range of inputs and reach edge cases.
 * the compounding effects of scale: really enjoy the discussions on how scale (10^2, 10^4, 10^6, or 10^8 users to manage) affect software design and complexity management.
 * leaky abstractions (also related to accidental complexity or abstraction gap) when developers need to understand hidden details of an interface to use it effectively.
 * rebound effect: Organizations and individuals have a complexity "budget." When tools or techniques reduce complexity, we tend to "spend" that gain by tackling more complex problems or adding more features, thus returning to a similar level of perceived complexity as before. It's related to the Jevon's Paradox that is used in economis and Green IT, but I find it so true in software engineering as well. Also enjoyed the connection with [homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis).
 * variability and combinatorial explosion (called "hyperspace" in the talk) when you typically have to test on 3 screens, 5 browsers, 2 operating systems, etc. It rings a bell to my own research work, where variability adds further complexity (but also added value) to software systems. May I suggest some publications: a call for removing variability (https://hal.science/hal-03882594), a study on testing JHipster configurations (https://inria.hal.science/hal-01829928), etc.
 * ... and more.


I especially appreciated the use of simple, intuitive examples to illustrate each point. These arenâ€™t necessarily new problems, but theyâ€™re presented with unusual clarity and connect the dots with some concepts. Itâ€™s a refreshing, well-articulated perspective on problems most developers have run into but often donâ€™t step back to analyze.

There is no silver bullet, but the suggestions of doing less with less (also: more constraints imposed to reduce complexity) or starting over (possibly from scratch) are intriguing. Long road ahead, but it's a good start to acknowledge the complexity and start addressing it.

Highly recommended viewing for anyone interested in building more resilient, understandable systems: ðŸ“º [Watch the talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czzAVuVz7u4)
