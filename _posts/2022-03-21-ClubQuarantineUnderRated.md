Some songs / tracks are amazing, but deserve much^more views.
It's really surprising... and meanwhile it's a bit what we are seeking sometimes: some hidden gems ;)
I am a huge fan of listening to DJ sets and then identifying "killer" tracks. 
The amazing https://www.1001tracklists.com/ has democratized the sharing of tracklist to a next level.
Some IDs remain IDs forever... but not all fortunately. 

As part of the celebration of Club Quarantine (CQ) 2 year anniversary (with Dave Dresden, Josh Gabriel, Sub Teal, and many amazing guests) https://www.twitch.tv/gabrielanddresden I've compiled a small set of such underrated tracks:
 * Apollon Telefax - People Is Product (Theus Mago Remix) https://soundcloud.com/calypsorecs/apollon-telefax-people-is-product-theus-mago-remix 118 likes, 3K listening on soundcloud... Sub Teal played it a number of times in CQ and she's right! 
 * Jonas Saalbach & Yuven - Providence http://youtu.be/KR7h0G6Oj10 Jonas Saalbach is quite well-known but this specific track has less than 2K listening on Youtube... seriously? 
 * Mulya - Brick Talks https://youtu.be/GnHHm4htjAs 3K views on Youtube, come on! 
 * Soul Button - Meridian (Alex Rusin Remix) https://youtu.be/VuULmEDB2Dc 3K views on Youtube
 * Automatic feat. Peaches (Rex The Dog Vocal Remix) https://youtu.be/fFD04aex4zE this one is getting better with almost 10K views on Youtube... it was played in the CQ 1 year anniversary. 

I've mainly focused on CQ with Sub Teal and Josh Gabriel.
But I could well share some tracks of Dave Dresden or other artists. 
Overall, I found the number of likes in Youtube or soundcloud to be ridiculously low.
Maybe the metrics are wrong and eg Spotify gives better audience.
Of course I was not expecting millions of views for such tracks, but still ;)

Please share underrated gems!
