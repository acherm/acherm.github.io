I spent a couple of days in Japan (mainly Tokyo) for visiting the [National Institute of Informatics (NII)](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) and attending the [27th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference](https://2023.splc.net/) (SPLC 2023). 
I have been involved in several scientific activities:
 * [talk about deep software variability and reproducibility/replicability in computational science](/DeepVariabilityReplicability/) at SES 2023, IPSJ/SIGSE Software Engineering Symposium in Tokyo, Japan
 * [talk about ChatGPT and reengineering variants](/VariantsAndLLM/)
 * [talk about ChatGPT and programming variability/variants](/ChatGPTVariability/) 
 * panel about intelligent software product lines: I defended some ideas (eg intelligent assistants for exploring variants' space) and research directions (eg generative AI for software product lines) https://twitter.com/FortzSophie/status/1697133197686173933 https://twitter.com/FortzSophie/status/1697115284300235072 
 * chairing of the [session about feature model evolution and analysis](https://2023.splc.net/program/main-conference-program/)
 * steering committee of [SPLC](https://splc.net)
 * many, many discussions

Japan was truly amazing, I highly recommend, and we researchers are lucky to visit incredible locations and meet diverse people!

*(new!) I realized that some of my blog post entries are sometimes cited in academic works, so why not using the following bibtex entry?*
