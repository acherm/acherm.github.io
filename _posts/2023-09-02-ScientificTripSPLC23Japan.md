I spent a couple of days in Japan (mainly Tokyo) for visiting the [National Institute of Informatics (NII)](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) and attending the [27th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference](https://2023.splc.net/) (SPLC 2023). 
I have been involved in several scientific activities:
 * talk about deep software variability and reproducibility/replicability in computational science at SES 2023, IPSJ/SIGSE Software Engineering Symposium in Tokyo, Japan
 * talk about ChatGPT and reengineering variants 
 * talk about ChatGPT and programming variability/variants 
 * panel about intelligent software product lines: I defended some ideas (eg intelligent assistants for exploring variants' space) and research directions (eg generative AI for software product lines)
 * chairing of the session about feature model evolution and analysis
 * steering committee of SPLC
 * many, many discussions

 Japan was amazing, I highly recommend, and we researchers are lucky to visit incredible locations and meet diverse people!
