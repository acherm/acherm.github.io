🧪 A short pause in the summer break... for a presentation at the 2025 ACM Conference on Reproducibility and Replicability (https://lnkd.in/gchUUYV3), a super important but overlooked topic in science! 
I presented the paper entitled "Teaching Reproducibility and Embracing Variability: From Floating-Point Experiments to Replicating Research"

🇨🇦 The conference took place in Vancouver, but I presented remotely from France — live at 11:50 PM, and without the heatwave this time 😉.
🎓 I had the chance to present a 26-hour hands-on course I taught at INSA Rennes, entirely focused on reproducibility and variability in computational experiments.

The course blends scientific inquiry, advanced software engineering, and variability analysis. Students don't just talk about reproducibility — they reproduce and replicate actual research. This year, they explored:
⚽️ Home advantage in football during COVID https://blog.mathieuacher.com/FootballAnalysis-xG-COVIDHome/
♟️ Large language models playing chess https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/
🔋 Energy consumption across programming languages (SCP 2021)

From a "Hello World" on floating-point arithmetic to full replications of published studies, students identified subtle reproducibility issues (like shifting library defaults) and explored meaningful variations — sometimes even spotting flaws in my own prior work!

🤝 This is joint work with Arnaud Gotlieb, Helge Spieker, and Gauthier Le Bartz Lyan, as part of the RIPOST team (Resilient and Reproducible Software — https://diverse-project.github.io/ripost_ea/), a collaborative effort between Simula Research Laboratory and Inria.

💡 Teaching reproducibility means embracing variability, critical thinking, and learning from students.
Can't wait to... replicate the course again at INSA Rennes in Fall 2025!

I have two remaining questions:
 * What's your hello world for reproducibility? Ideally simple to "get", engaging, and covering many technical and methodological aspects of reproducibility...
 * What are the success criteria of a reproducibility course? I had some evidence that the course went well (mainly based on high-quality works of students and their ability to reproduce and replicate in a very interesting way), but I'd like to have a kind of protocol to better assess the course.
