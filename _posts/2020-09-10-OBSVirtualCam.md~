As part of now remote conferences or courses, you may need to show many things: not only your slides, but also your terminal, your browser, or you!
There are many (proprietary) systems out there for sharing your screen live: BigBlueButton, Jitsi, Google meet, Zoom, Skype, Teams, etc.
My recent experience is that it does not work so well. Hence an idea is to create a **virtual camera** and project what you want through it.
That is, you create this fake camera and then broadcast to any conferencing system (you "just" have to select the virtual cam).
Some details below about I setup everything to achieve this.

The starting point was this nice blog post [https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/using-obs-studio-as-a-virtual-cam-on-linux]("Broadcast from OBS Studio To Everything In Linux").
Olivier Barais, a colleague of mine, shared this idea and article a few months ago, but I didn't get much attention at that time.
