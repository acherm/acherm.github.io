2019 is over and it's a good excuse to report on failures and successes (in no particular order):

* most influential paper (MIP) award together with Philippe Collet, Philippe Lahire, and Robert B. France, at [SLE 2019](http://www.sleconf.org/2019/) for our 2009 paper “Composing feature models”. [slides](https://fr.slideshare.net/PhilCollet/sle-2019-mip-award-sle-2009-composing-feature-models) and [press release (in french)](https://ins2i.cnrs.fr/fr/cnrsinfo/des-scientifiques-primes-pour-leurs-travaux-sur-les-feature-models)

* reject of my ERC starting grant (called REVARY for Resurrecting Software Variability). Brain-consuming work that forces you to go beyond the usual territory... the cut was 29% (I was ranked between 30% and 40% grrr), but really worth doing. I have now an explicit and ambitious research plan for... 2020 at least ;)

* reject of ICSE submission:  [preprint](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02314830) is available and already working hard to address reviews. Very frustrating since we worked hard, including in the middle of summer time… and the subject is exciting/challenging (can we learn the enormous configuration space of the Linux kernel with 15,000+ options?) 

* accept at Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE) journal for [Empirical Assessment of Multimorphic Testing](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02177158) The idea of Multimorphic testing is to assess the effectiveness of a test suite for revealing performance variations of a system (something surprinsingly not so common in the scientific literature).

* reject of ICSE SEIP submission: [preprint](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02147012) is available… again on Linux and its configuration space. I strongly believe we need a "smart" continuous integration system capable of tracking/dealing with configuration failures of the Linux kernel

* [talk](http://blog.mathieuacher.com/ELCETuxML/) at Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2019: a very nice experience (I hope to attend/talk again in such non-academic events!)

* [an intense year of teaching](http://blog.mathieuacher.com/Teaching1819/): a kind of failure (too much!) and success (I learned a lot eg <http://blog.mathieuacher.com/WikipediaMatrixChallenge/>)

* a few blog posts 

* many [interesting](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02287616) works on [sampling](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02356290) and [learning](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02287459) configuration spaces (see also this [survey](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02148791))

* co-chairing of [VaMoS](https://vamos2020.dbse.iti.cs.ovgu.de/) (14th International Working Conference on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems) with Maxime Cordy: proud to help the variability community! 

* only one flight (from France to Greece)

* zero official chess game: my last one was in the previous decade (very strange to explain)… I'm playing a bit more online though, above 2400 ;) 

* back in the football business every friday night ;-) fully for 90 minutes (sometimes midfielder, sometimes centre-forward)
